## What the blog is about (big picture)

The article moves beyond simple fully connected (flattened image) networks and explains **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, which are specialized for image (or other spatial data) tasks. The motivation is that flat networks ‚Äúpay attention‚Äù to exact pixel positions, and slight shifts in input can mess them up. CNNs, by using local receptive fields (kernels/filters) + pooling + activation, learn features that are more robust to spatial variation and can capture shapes, edges, textures etc., which makes them much better for image tasks like recognizing handwritten letters.

## What is a CNN?

A CNN is a neural network that uses¬†**convolutional layers**¬†which apply filters (also called kernels) sliding over the input image to detect features such as edges, textures, shapes, and eventually complex objects.
## Key concepts introduced & explained

Here are the main ideas in the blog, with what they do, why they matter, and how their mechanics work. I‚Äôll follow with simple toy examples to make them concrete.

1. **Convolutional Layers (Kernels / Filters)**
2. **Multiple Input / Output Channels**
3. **Max-Pooling**
4. **Non-linear activation (GELU in this case)**
5. **Stacking of convolution + pooling + activation**
6. **Flattening + Fully Connected Layers + LogSoftMax (output)**
7. **Back-propagation of convolution (how gradients flow through conv layers)**

#### Mechanics of each concept, with simple examples

##### 1. Convolutional Layers (Kernels / Filters)

**What it is:**  
A convolutional layer applies one or more small ‚Äúkernels‚Äù (also called filters) over the input image (or feature map). Each kernel is a small matrix (e.g., 3√ó3). For each position in the image, the kernel ‚Äúslides‚Äù over (i.e. is placed so that the kernel‚Äôs window covers some pixels), you multiply element-wise and sum to get a single number. This produces an _output feature map_ which shows how well that kernel matched features in different places of the image.

**Why it matters:**

- Captures **local structure** (edges, corners etc.) rather than treating each pixel independent and globally.
- Reuse of the same kernel over all positions means fewer parameters (shared weights) ‚Üí less overfitting + more efficient.
- Because kernels slide, position invariance begins (the feature can be detected anywhere in the image).

**Toy Example:**
Suppose you have a grayscale image of size 5√ó5:
```makefile
Image:

1 2 3 0 1
0 1 2 1 0
1 0 1 2 3
0 1 1 0 2
1 2 0 1 0

```
You use a single 3√ó3 kernel (filter):
```makefile
Kernel:

1 0 -1
1 0 -1
1 0 -1
```
This kernel is designed to detect vertical edges (approx). You slide this kernel over all possible 3√ó3 patches of the 5√ó5 image. For example:

- Position top left (covering rows 1-3, columns 1-3):
    Patch:
```makefile
1 2 3
0 1 2
1 0 1
```
Multiply element-wise:
```makefile
1*1 + 0*2 + (-1)*3
+ 1*0 + 0*1 + (-1)*2
+ 1*1 + 0*0 + (-1)*1
= (1 + 0 - 3) + (0 + 0 - 2) + (1 + 0 - 1)
= (-2) + (-2) + (0) = -4
```
That gives the output at that location. You repeat for all valid positions (there are `(5 ‚àí 3 + 1) = 3` positions in rows and columns each, so output 3√ó3 feature map).

Thus, convolution converts 5√ó5 ‚Üí 3√ó3 with a 3√ó3 kernel (no padding, stride 1).
If you have multiple kernels, you get multiple output feature maps.

##### 2. Multiple Input / Output Channels

Real images often have multiple channels (e.g., RGB has 3). For intermediate layers, you get multiple ‚Äúfeature maps‚Äù (channels). Each output channel is formed by kernels applied over **all input channels**, summed together (plus a bias).
**Example:**

- Suppose your input is of size 5√ó5√ó3 (3 input channels).
- You pick 2 output channels (i.e. 2 filters).
- Each filter has shape 3√ó3√ó3 (kernel height √ó width √ó input_channels). So filter_1 has 3√ó3√ó3 weights, filter_2 has its own 3√ó3√ó3.

For each output channel:
- At each position (sliding window) you perform: for that position, extract a 3√ó3 patch _from each input channel_, multiply each with the corresponding slice of the filter, sum over all input channels & all positions inside kernel. Then add bias.
So output becomes (with stride 1, no padding): output_channels √ó (input_height ‚àí kernel +1) √ó (input_width ‚àí kernel +1). E.g. 2 √ó 3 √ó 3 in our toy.
##### 3. Max-Pooling

**What it is:**  
After convolution + activation, often apply a pooling operation. Max-pooling (2√ó2) is common: it takes non-overlapping 2√ó2 windows, and for each, picks the maximum. This reduces (downsamples) height and width dimensions, while preserving (some) spatial localization. Helps reduce number of computations, parameters, overfitting, and gives some translation invariance.

**Toy Example:**
Take a 4√ó4 feature map:
```
Feature map:

1 3 2 4
5 6 1 0
2 9 7 3
4 2 8 1
```
Using 2√ó2 max pooling (non-overlapping), we split into four 2√ó2 blocks:
- Block (rows 1-2, cols 1-2):  
    `1 3; 5 6` ‚Üí max = 6
- Block (rows 1-2, cols 3-4):  
    `2 4; 1 0` ‚Üí max = 4
- Block (rows 3-4, cols 1-2):  
    `2 9; 4 2` ‚Üí max = 9
- Block (rows 3-4, cols 3-4):  
    `7 3; 8 1` ‚Üí max = 8
So pooled output is:
```
6  4
9  8
```
This halves both width and height (4√ó4 ‚Üí 2√ó2), for each channel.
##### 4. Activation functions (GELU in blog, earlier RELU)

- After convolution (and possibly pooling), apply a non-linear function, because stacking linear operations alone is just linear. Non-linearities give the network expressive power.
- The blog uses **GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit)** instead of RELU. GELU is smoother; RELU simply zeros out negative inputs; GELU weights negative values by a smooth curve (i.e. ‚Äúsignal‚Äù them rather than zero). But for beginning, understanding RELU is enough.

**Toy Example:**
- If input to activation is `[-1, 0, 2, 3]`:
    - RELU outputs `[0, 0, 2, 3]`
    - GELU outputs something like `‚âà [small negative smooth, ~0, ~2, ~3]` (not zero¬≠ing everything negative, but dampening them). We won‚Äôt get into exact formula now.
##### 5. Putting convolution + pooling + activation in stacks

The blog‚Äôs model architecture (for reading letters) is:

1. Input: 28√ó28 image.
2. Conv layer (3√ó3 kernels), 1 input channel ‚Üí 32 output channels ‚Üí output size becomes 26√ó26 (because 28‚àí3+1 = 26) in height & width.
3. MaxPooling 2√ó2 ‚Üí shrinks to 13√ó13.
4. Activation (GELU).
5. Another Conv 3√ó3: 32 input ‚Üí 64 output, etc.
6. MaxPool ‚Üí activation.
7. Third convolution + maxpool + activation.
8. Flatten ‚Üí Linear (fully connected) layers ‚Üí final output ‚Üí LogSoftMax.

Each set of conv + pool + activation helps the network build more abstract, higher-level features. Early layers might detect edges; deeper layers detect combinations like curves, shapes, parts of letters etc.

##### 6. LogSoftMax + Output Layer

At the end, after all convolutions etc., the feature maps are flattened into a vector. Then fully connected (‚Äúlinear‚Äù) layers are used to map to the number of classes (in this blog, 26 letters). Then LogSoftMax is applied to the outputs (logits) to produce log-probabilities over the classes. The loss is negative of the correct class log-probability (same as doing cross-entropy with log probabilities). The blog uses `-(expected * scores).sum()` where `scores` is the LogSoftMax result and `expected` is the one-hot correct class vector.

##### 7. Backward / Gradients in Conv

The blog also explains how convolution backprop works in principle:

- When you do a forward convolution, for each output position, you combine input patch * filter weights + bias.
- Backpropagation must compute how changing each filter weight would change the loss, and how changing each input (earlier layers) would change loss (so that gradients propagate backward).
- The gradient w.r.t the filter is basically sum over all positions: input patch √ó gradient at each output position.
- The gradient w.r.t input is similar: for each output gradient, the corresponding kernel weights influence input patches.

Although the code in the blog is more low-level (nested loops), conceptually it‚Äôs the chain rule.

Yes üöÄ great idea ‚Äî pictographic representations make CNNs much easier to grasp. Let‚Äôs break down **how an image flows through a CNN** using kernels, filters, and pooling ‚Äî step by step with intuitive examples. I‚Äôll use **simple grayscale images** and ASCII/pseudo-visuals so you can ‚Äúsee‚Äù what‚Äôs happening at each stage.

---
# üìå CNN Mechanics Pictorially
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Input Image
Suppose we have a **5√ó5 grayscale image** (values represent pixel intensity, darker = higher number):
```
Input Image:
1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0
```
This could be part of a digit like ‚Äú7‚Äù.

---
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Convolution with Kernel
Take a **3√ó3 kernel** (like an edge detector):
```
Kernel (Filter):
1  0 -1
1  0 -1
1  0 -1
```

This kernel detects **vertical edges**.
üîÑ Perform convolution ‚Üí multiply kernel with a **sliding window** of the image and sum up.
Resulting **Feature Map** (convolved output, smaller because of sliding):
```
Feature Map after Convolution:
2  1  -1
1  0  -2
0 -1  -2
```
üëâ Bright areas = vertical edges detected.

---
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Non-linearity (ReLU)
We pass through **ReLU = max(0, x)** to keep only positive signals:
```
After ReLU:
2  1  0
1  0  0
0  0  0
```

Now the map highlights **only strong edges**.

---
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pooling (Downsampling)

Apply **2√ó2 max pooling** ‚Üí take max from each block:
```
Pooling Window (2√ó2 max):
[2,1] ‚Üí 2
[1,0] ‚Üí 1
[0,0] ‚Üí 0
```
Result:
```
After MaxPooling:
2  0
1  0
```

üëâ Image shrinks, but key features remain (edges).

---
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Multiple Filters = Multiple Feature Maps
CNNs use many filters to learn different features:
- One filter learns **vertical edges**
- Another learns **horizontal edges**
- Another learns **diagonal patterns**
Visually:
```
Filter 1 (Vertical) ‚Üí Feature Map 1
Filter 2 (Horizontal) ‚Üí Feature Map 2
Filter 3 (Diagonal) ‚Üí Feature Map 3
```
Stacked together, they form a **multi-channel feature representation** of the image.

---
### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Flatten + Fully Connected Layers

After several rounds of convolution + pooling:
- The image is compressed into abstract features (like ‚Äúhas a curve‚Äù, ‚Äúhas a corner‚Äù).
- Flatten ‚Üí turn into a vector.
- Pass through fully connected layers ‚Üí final classification (e.g., digit `7`).

---
# üìå Intuition Recap
- **Kernels** = small pattern detectors (edges, textures).
- **Convolutions** = scanning the image to detect patterns.
- **ReLU** = keep only strong signals.
- **Pooling** = compress while keeping important info.
- **Stacking layers** = learn simple ‚Üí complex features (edges ‚Üí shapes ‚Üí objects).

---
‚ö° CNNs work because instead of learning all pixels directly, they learn **useful building blocks of images** step by step.

---

üëâ Do you want me to **generate actual visual plots (heatmaps at each stage)** for a toy image using Python (matplotlib + PyTorch/NumPy)? That way, you‚Äôll see feature maps and pooling results as real images instead of ASCII.

### convolution matrix computation
Let's compute the full convolution output for the provided 5√ó5 input image using the 3√ó3 filter.
### Input Image (5√ó5):

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 5 \\
3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\

We will compute each of these 9 positions.

### Step 1: Slide filter over image patches and compute sums

Define notation: $$\text{Patch}(r,c)$$ is 3x3 image patch starting at row r, column c (0-indexed).
#### Position (0,0):

Sum:
$$
0*1 + 1*0 + 0*1 + 1*3 + (-4)*2 + 1*2 + 0*1 + 1*3 + 0*1 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 -8 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 0
$$
#### Position (2,0):
Patch:

\end{bmatrix}
$$
Sum:
$$
0*0 + 1*1 + 0*3 + 1*1 + (-4)*0 + 1*1 + 0*2 + 1*1 + 0*4 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 4
$$
#### Position (2,1):
Patch:

0*1 + 1*3 + 0*2 + 1*0 + (-4)*1 + 1*3 + 0*1 + 1*4 + 0*1 = 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 -4 + 3 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 6
$$
### Final output feature map (3√ó3):

### SECTION 3: FEATURE DETECTION WITH DIFFERENT KERNELS in CNNs.

### Feature Detection with Different Kernels (Filters)

The core idea behind CNNs is the ability to detect useful features in images through convolution operations using small matrices called **kernels** or **filters**. Different kernels detect different types of features such as edges, corners, textures, or smoothness.
### Test Image Example:
The example test image contains vertical and horizontal edges:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
### Applying Different Kernels to Detect Features
Each kernel highlights specific aspects of the input image by convolving with it, producing an output feature map where strong responses indicate detected features.
### 1. Vertical Edge Detector
**Kernel:**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 1 \\
-2 & 0 & 2 \\
-1 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
- Detects vertical edges by emphasizing differences between left and right neighboring pixels.
- Produces strong responses where vertical edges exist (like left and right boundaries).
**Output (sample):**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 3 & 0 & -3 & -3 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -1 \\
3 & 3 & 0 & -3 & -3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
### 2. Horizontal Edge Detector
**Kernel:**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & -2 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 2 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
- Detects horizontal edges by focusing on differences between top and bottom neighboring pixels.
- Produces strong responses at top and bottom boundaries.
**Output (sample):**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 3 \\
3 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-3 & -1 & 0 & -1 & -3 \\
-3 & -1 & 0 & -1 & -3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
### 3. Blur/Smoothing Kernel
**Kernel:**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0.1 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\
0.1 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\
0.1 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
- Smooths the image by averaging neighboring pixel values.
- Reduces sharp transitions or noise.
**Output (sample):**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0.6 & 0.8 & 1.0 & 0.8 & 0.6 \\
0.8 & 0.9 & 1.0 & 0.9 & 0.8 \\
1.0 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 1.0 \\
0.8 & 0.9 & 1.0 & 0.9 & 0.8 \\
0.6 & 0.8 & 1.0 & 0.8 & 0.6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
### 4. Sharpen Kernel
**Kernel:**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 & 0 \\
-1 & 5 & -1 \\
0 & -1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
- Enhances edges and details by amplifying differences.
- Makes image features sharper and highlights boundaries.
**Output (sample):**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & -2 \\
2 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
2 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
-2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & -2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$## 5. Corner Detection Kernel
**Kernel:**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & -1 & -1 \\
-1 & 8 & -1 \\
-1 & -1 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
- Designed to respond strongly where corner-like patterns appear.
- Highlights points in the image where intensity changes sharply in multiple directions.
**Output (sample):**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-5 & 2 & 0 & 2 & -5 \\
2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
-5 & 2 & 0 & 2 & -5 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
### What we learn:
1. **Vertical edge detectors** focus on left/right boundaries.
2. **Horizontal edge detectors** focus on top/bottom boundaries.
3. **Blur kernels** smooth out the image.
4. **Sharpen kernels** enhance edges.
5. **Corner detectors** detect corner patterns.

### Real CNNs:

- The network **learns** the best kernels during training.
- Kernels start randomly but evolve to detect features relevant for the task (e.g., faces, objects).
- Kernels capture complex, hierarchical features when stacked over many layers.

This understanding of kernels demonstrates how fundamental feature detection happens in CNNs which enable them to recognize objects robustly regardless of position or distortion.

==================================================

### SECTION 4: MAX POOLING AND SPATIAL REDUCTION

==================================================
Perfect üëå Let‚Äôs build an **intuitive but deep** understanding of CNN fundamentals ‚Äî edge detection, max pooling, spatial dimensions, and translation invariance ‚Äî using simple examples so that you can ‚Äúsee‚Äù how CNNs work without heavy math.

---

# üîé 1. Edge Detection (Why Kernels Matter)

CNNs use **kernels (filters)** to detect features in an image. A kernel is a small matrix (e.g., 3√ó3) that slides over the image.
üëâ Example:  
Take a simple 5√ó5 grayscale image (numbers = brightness):

```
1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0
```
This looks like a "7".
Now apply a **vertical edge detection kernel**:
```
1  0 -1
1  0 -1
1  0 -1
```
This kernel compares left vs right pixels.
- If the left side is bright and the right side is dark ‚Üí big positive value.
- If the opposite ‚Üí negative value.
- If equal ‚Üí near zero.
Resulting **feature map** highlights only vertical boundaries of the "7".
üí° Takeaway:
- Kernels let the network detect **edges, curves, textures** automatically.
- Early layers learn **low-level features** (edges), deeper layers combine them into **shapes and objects**.
---
# üìâ 2. Max Pooling (Downsampling While Keeping Important Info)

Pooling reduces the image size but keeps key features.
üëâ Example:  
Suppose you have a 4√ó4 feature map after convolution:
```
1  3  2  4
5  6  1  0
2  9  7  3
4  2  8  1
```

Now apply **2√ó2 Max Pooling** (take max from each 2√ó2 block):
- From `1 3; 5 6` ‚Üí max = 6
- From `2 4; 1 0` ‚Üí max = 4
- From `2 9; 4 2` ‚Üí max = 9
- From `7 3; 8 1` ‚Üí max = 8
Result:
```
6  4
9  8
```
üí° Takeaway:
- Pooling **shrinks dimensions** (4√ó4 ‚Üí 2√ó2).
- Reduces computation.
- Keeps **strongest signals** (important features).
- Adds **robustness** ‚Äî small changes in the image (like shifting the "7" by 1 pixel) won‚Äôt drastically change pooled values.
# üìê 3. Spatial Dimensions (Size Changes in CNNs)

The size of the feature map depends on:
- Input size (H√óW)
- Kernel size (K√óK)
- Stride (step size when sliding kernel)
- Padding (extra zeros added around input)
Formula:
```
Output size = (Input size ‚Äì Kernel size + 2*Padding)/Stride + 1
```
üëâ Example:
- Input = 28√ó28 image
- Kernel = 3√ó3
- Stride = 1
- Padding = 0
Output = (28 ‚àí 3 + 0)/1 + 1 = **26√ó26**
If we add padding=1:  
Output = (28 ‚àí 3 + 2)/1 + 1 = **28√ó28** (same size as input).

üí° Takeaway:
- Without padding ‚Üí image shrinks after each convolution.
- With padding ‚Üí keeps original size (common in practice).
- Pooling also reduces size (e.g., 2√ó2 pooling halves height & width).

# üîÑ 4. Translation Invariance (Why CNNs Beat Flat Networks)

**Problem with traditional neural nets:**  
If a digit "7" shifts a bit to the left or right, a fully connected network may fail because pixel positions changed.

**CNN solution:**
- Convolutions detect patterns **wherever they appear** (same kernel slides over entire image).
- Pooling makes the detection less sensitive to exact position.

üëâ Example:  
Imagine two versions of "7":
- One slightly left-aligned
- One slightly right-aligned

The **vertical edge filter** will still detect the edges, just in slightly shifted positions.  
Pooling compresses them ‚Üí the network sees **‚Äúthere‚Äôs a vertical edge somewhere‚Äù** instead of worrying about exact location.

üí° Takeaway:
- CNNs are naturally good at handling **shifts, rotations, and small distortions**.
- That‚Äôs why they dominate in image tasks.
# üéØ Putting It All Together

1. **Convolution (Kernels)** ‚Üí Detect edges/features.
2. **Activation (ReLU)** ‚Üí Keep strong signals only.
3. **Pooling** ‚Üí Shrink size, keep key features, gain robustness.
4. **Stack multiple layers** ‚Üí Low-level features ‚Üí shapes ‚Üí objects.
5. **Fully Connected Layers** ‚Üí Make decision (e.g., "This is a 7").

‚úÖ In short:  
CNNs = "smart magnifying glasses" that learn to detect patterns ‚Üí compress them ‚Üí recognize bigger structures ‚Üí classify.

### SECTION 5: ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS - RELU VS GELU

============================================================

        ‚ö° ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS: INTRODUCING NON-LINEARITY

        Without activation functions, multiple linear layers = one linear layer!
        Activation functions enable networks to learn complex patterns.

üìä ACTIVATION FUNCTION COMPARISON:

Input range: -3.0 to 3.0


 Input |     ReLU |     GELU
--------------------------

  -2.0 |    0.000 |   -0.045
  -1.0 |    0.000 |   -0.159
  -0.5 |    0.000 |   -0.154
   0.0 |    0.000 |    0.000
   0.5 |    0.500 |    0.346
   1.0 |    1.000 |    0.841
   2.0 |    2.000 |    1.955

        üîç KEY DIFFERENCES:

        RELU (Rectified Linear Unit):
        ‚úÖ Simple and fast: f(x) = max(0, x)
        ‚úÖ Prevents vanishing gradients for x > 0
        ‚ùå "Dead neurons" problem: gradient = 0 for x < 0
        ‚ùå Sharp discontinuity at x = 0

        GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit):
        ‚úÖ Smooth activation (differentiable everywhere)
        ‚úÖ Better gradient flow for negative values
        ‚úÖ Often achieves better performance in practice
        ‚ùå More computationally expensive
        ‚ùå More complex to understand


üíÄ DEAD NEURON DEMONSTRATION:
For large negative inputs:
   Input |     ReLU |   ReLU Gradient |     GELU |    GELU keeps signal
-----------------------------------------------------------------
    -2.5 |    0.000 |               0 |   -0.015 |                  Yes
    -1.8 |    0.000 |               0 |   -0.065 |                  Yes
    -0.3 |    0.000 |               0 |   -0.115 |                  Yes
    -0.1 |    0.000 |               0 |   -0.046 |                  Yes

        üí° PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATION:
        - Use ReLU for simple/fast prototypes
        - Use GELU for better performance (if computational cost allows)
        - Modern architectures (Transformers, etc.) prefer GELU

üèóÔ∏è DESIGNING A COMPLETE CNN FOR DIGIT CLASSIFICATION

Let's design a CNN step by step, understanding why each layer is chosen.
PROBLEM: Classify 28√ó28 handwritten digits (0-9)

--------------------------------------------------------------
     Input |      28√ó28√ó1 |            Original grayscale image
     Conv1 |     26√ó26√ó32 |        3√ó3 kernels, 32 feature maps
     ReLU1 |     26√ó26√ó32 |        Nonlinearity
	MaxPool1 |     13√ó13√ó32 |               2√ó2 pooling, stride 2
    Conv2 |     11√ó11√ó64 |        3√ó3 kernels, 64 feature maps
    ReLU2 |     11√ó11√ó64 |                       Non\-linearity
    MaxPool2 |       5√ó5√ó64 |               2√ó2 pooling, stride 2
     Flatten |       1600√ó1 |         Prepare for fully connected
       FC1 |        128√ó1 |                   First dense layer

       Softmax |         10√ó1 |            Probability distribution

üßÆ PARAMETER COUNT ANALYSIS:

`Conv1 parameters:`  320 (3√ó3√ó1√ó32 + 32 biases)
`Conv2 parameters:`  18,496 (3√ó3√ó32√ó64 + 64 biases)
`FC1 parameters:`  204,928 (1600√ó128 + 128 biases)
`FC2 parameters:`  1,290 (128√ó10 + 10 biases)
`Total parameters:`  225,034

üí≠ DESIGN RATIONALE:

        1. CONV1 (32 filters): Detect basic edges, corners, curves
           Small number sufficient for low-level features
        2. MAXPOOL1: Reduce size, add translation invariance
           13√ó13 still preserves spatial relationships
        3. CONV2 (64 filters): Combine basic features into complex patterns
           More filters needed for complex feature combinations
        4. MAXPOOL2: Further reduction to 5√ó5
           Still enough resolution for digit recognition
        5. FLATTEN: Convert 2D feature maps to 1D vector
           Needed for fully connected layers
        6. FC1 (128 neurons): Learn complex combinations of spatial features
           128 provides good capacity without overfitting
        7. FC2 (10 neurons): Final classification layer
           One neuron per digit class (0-9)
