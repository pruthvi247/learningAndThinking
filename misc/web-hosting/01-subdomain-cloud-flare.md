✅ Excellent question — and **yes, absolutely** you can do this.

But to be precise:  
👉 `hoopinc.in` and `hoopincapp.in` are **two different domains**,  
👉 whereas something like `app.hoopinc.in` or `blog.hoopinc.in` are **subdomains** of `hoopinc.in`.

So you have **two options** depending on what you want to achieve:

---

## 🅰️ **Option 1 — Subdomain under the same domain (recommended)**

👉 Examples:

- `hoopinc.in` → main website
    
- `app.hoopinc.in` → a different web app
    
- `blog.hoopinc.in` → blog or docs site
    

✅ This is the cleanest setup and easy to manage in Cloudflare.

---

### 🧭 How to set it up with Cloudflare Pages (or any host):

#### 1. Host or deploy your **main site** at `hoopinc.in`

- Already done as per previous steps.
    

#### 2. Add a **new subdomain** (e.g., `app.hoopinc.in`) in Cloudflare DNS:

- Go to **Cloudflare → hoopinc.in → DNS**
    
- Add:
    
    ```
    Type: CNAME
    Name: app
    Target: <your app hosting URL> (e.g., yourapp.pages.dev)
    Proxy: ON (orange cloud)
    ```
    

#### 3. Deploy a **separate site** for the subdomain

- You can create another **Cloudflare Pages project** (e.g., `hoopinc-app`) and upload a different codebase.
    
- Then add `app.hoopinc.in` as a **Custom Domain** in that project.
    

#### 4. SSL & HTTPS

- Cloudflare automatically issues a **free SSL certificate** for subdomains as well.
    
- No separate SSL setup required. ✅
    

#### 5. Optional Redirects

If needed, you can create rules like:

```
hoopinc.in → main marketing site
app.hoopinc.in → product or web app
blog.hoopinc.in → docs/blog
```

✅ Works seamlessly and uses the same Cloudflare account.

---

## 🅱️ **Option 2 — Different domain (e.g., hoopincapp.in)**

This is **not a subdomain**, but a **completely separate domain**.  
You’ll need to:

1. **Buy `hoopincapp.in`** if you don’t already own it.
    
2. Add it to **Cloudflare** as a new site.
    
3. Deploy a different website (e.g., separate Cloudflare Pages project or hosting).
    
4. Set up DNS and SSL for this domain separately (same steps as `hoopinc.in`).
    

✅ This is a good approach if:

- You want brand separation (e.g., product vs company)
    
- You want different teams or environments
    

🚫 Downside:

- You manage DNS/SSL separately.
    
- More overhead than subdomains.

## 🏗️ Example Setup

|Domain / Subdomain|Purpose|Hosting Method|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|`hoopinc.in`|Main marketing site|Cloudflare Pages|Free SSL, CDN|
|`app.hoopinc.in`|Web app|Separate Pages project / VM|Separate codebase|
|`blog.hoopinc.in`|Blog/docs|Third Pages project|Optional|
|`hoopincapp.in` (optional)|Separate product site|New domain on Cloudflare|Managed independently|

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips:

- You can set up **redirect rules** in Cloudflare easily between these.
    
- All subdomains automatically inherit your **SSL coverage** when proxied through Cloudflare.
    
- If you need API/backend on a subdomain (like `api.hoopinc.in`), the same pattern applies.
    

---

👉 In short:

- ✅ Yes, you can have multiple subdomains under `hoopinc.in` with different sites.
    
- 🆓 Each subdomain gets free SSL via Cloudflare.
    
- 🌍 Everything is managed cleanly from a single Cloudflare dashboard.
